NFT Transaction System (NTS) is an application used to buy and sell NFTâ€™s. Based on their previous amount of
transactions, each trader is assigned to one of two levels. A trader is categorized as a "Gold" customer and is
assessed a different fee rate for the transaction in the following month once they have executed more than $100K
in trades (buy or sell) in the previous month. If not, the trader is categorized as "Silver." Every month, this
categorization will be revised. Managers and traders each have their own home pages. If a trader has adequate fiat
balance in his account, he or she may purchase NFTs. Additionally, traders have the choice of selling NFTs with a
commission rate in either fiat money or Ethereum. Traders can cancel a certain payment or NFT transaction up to
15 minutes of transaction submission. Based on the dates entered by the manager, the manager can provide
aggregate information for daily, weekly, and monthly total transactions.
